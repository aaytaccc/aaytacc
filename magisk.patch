# Binaries like magisk, magiskinit, and all symlinks to
# applets are directly stored in this path. This means when

# Magisk's BusyBox directory. Within this folder stores
# the busybox binary and symlinks to all of its applets.
# Any usage of this directory is deprecated, please
# directly call /data/adb/magisk/busybox and use
# BusyBox's ASH Standalone mode.
# The creation of this path will be removed in the future.

# /data/adb/modules will be bind mounted here.
